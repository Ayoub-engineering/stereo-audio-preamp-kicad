# Stereo Audio Pre-Amplifier with LED Level Indicator (KiCad)

## Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of a stereo analog audio pre-amplifier with an integrated LED level indicator.
The system amplifies low-level audio signals and provides a visual indication of signal activity.
